          <p className="guide-text">
            The easiest way for developers to get familiar with Blockchain
            Certificates is to clone the blockcerts-verifier repo and perform
            the steps in the README to launch. After this, you will be able to
            view and verify sample certificates locally.
            <br />
            <br />
            Developers wishing to create their own UI but leverage Blockcerts
            tooling for verification can use the cert-verifier-js project. This
            Javascript library for Blockcerts verification can be used in a
            Node.js app or a browser. We are currently using this library for
            blockcerts-verifier, the Blockcerts iOS wallet, and the Android
            wallet.
            <br />
            <br />
            If developing a separate library or those looking for more
            information about the verification process, that can be found here.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some examples of certificates can be found in the cert-schema repo.

            You can create, issue, and view your own certificates in test modes,
            which doesnâ€™t require spending Bitcoin. We highly recommend trying
            this process in test mode before issuing certificates on the live
            Bitcoin blockchain.
            <br />
            <br />
            The full process is:
            <br />
            <br />
            Create certificates with cert-tools or skip this step to use the
            sample ones in cert-issuer.
            <br />
            Copy the certificates and issue them with cert-issuer. Follow the
            quick-start-using-docker guide to get started easily.
            <br />
            Run the blockcerts-verifier project to verify the certificates you
            just issued. You can drag and drop them directly onto the browser.
            <br />
            Import them into the iOS wallet or the Android wallet to verify them
            there as well.
